# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## Issues

- The tasks weren't decided together.
- Issues weren't closed on GitHub.
- Our backlog wasn't updated properly after issues had been completed.

## Actions

- In the next sprint, we will discuss the issues as a group and divide the tasks then.
- Everyone remembers to keep up with issues, and moves them to In Progress and when completed, closes them and moves them to the Done section.

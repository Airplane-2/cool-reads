# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## Issues

- One of us had a n issue with the project not working.
- Internal communication issues.
- Tasks were not split evenly.
- We didn't do the optional user story.

## Actions

- An earlier daily scrum to ensure that everyone knows what to do early and everyone should at least check if things work as early as possible.
- Have better planning and divide the tasks more evenly.
- If issues seem impossible, delete your local project and clone it from GitHub again.
- If we have time, we should implement the optional user story of creating a search filter.

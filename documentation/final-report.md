## Challenges

### Sprint 1

We didn't have too many issues with the code, because the tasks were quite simple.

Using Issues to keep track of what we did was new to us, so we didn't remember to close them. And we didn't remember to move them in the backlog as we did things.

We discussed about these challenges and agreed on trying to keep up with the backlog and the issues in the next sprints.

### Sprint 2

We had some technical difficulties with eclipse and some issues when pulling the code from the repository. The code was still quite simple and we didn't have too many issues with it.

We had minor communication problems that might have caused this, because some things were pushed in that then made it difficult to remove the faulty recommendations.

Some of the team had a lot of other school projects that made planning more complicated. We managed to push past this issue, by agreeing that one of us took a bit more responsibility of the code for this Sprint.

The backlog managing was working better.


### Sprint 3

We had some issues with communication once again, because we used different approaches to solve the spring security. We discussed after we noticed this issue, and were able to come to a satisfying agreement and the code works.

The tasks to hide things in the frontend required things that we had not used before. To be able to hide the add recommendation button, we needed to use Async Await, which we had only skimmed through in front-end course.

School was finishing up, so we had a lot of other deadlines and exams approaching, so that created some planning difficulties, but we managed through them.

## Successes And What To Improve

We managed to do the required functionalities. We were able to divide the work well.

We learned that communication is very important and we all learned that we should more actively inform others about what we have done and how. Even small examples can help others to build up on existing code.

## Learning Experience

We learned some new things about React (Async Await) and a lot of things about Scrum.

It was interesting to see how Scrum can be used in a project environment and this was a very different team exercise compared to other school team projects. Doing something else than a presentation makes the dividing of work easier, and everyone can play to their strengths.
